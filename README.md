# Machine_Learning
As an aspiring machine learning practitioner, I recognize the importance of not just learning the theory of the field, but also being able to apply it in practice. To that end, I have been actively engaged in writing python code that implements the different machine learning concepts and techniques that I have been learning.

To ensure that my code is of high quality and adheres to professional standards, I have been following best practices in software development. This includes modularization, version control, and proper documentation. I also take care to thoroughly test my code to ensure that it is reliable and accurate.
